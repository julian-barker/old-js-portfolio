# MySite

- My personal website to eventually host my portfolio, contact info, background, etc

- This repository will hopefully contain my About Me / Portfolio personal website all throughout my career!

- Currently the site has the following features:
    - a logo and nav bar
    - a prompt and subsequent greeting to a user
    - a canvas for js to draw on
    - 4 versions of a guessing game
    - an About Me section
    - a portfolio section
    - a section with several top 10 lists
    - a footer with contact info
