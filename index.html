            Hi <span id="guest"></span>, I'm Julian!<br>I'm a <em>junior software developer</em> who loves <em>building</em> on the web, 
            <em>learning</em> about new tools and frameworks, and <em>expanding</em> my knowledge into other 
            fields like cyber security, AI/ML, and blockchain / distributed ledger technologies.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I grew up in southwest Connecticut with my parents and brother. I was always interested in technology and science, but never 
                broke into the self-taught coder life in my youth. After high school, I attended the United States Military Academy, through 
                which I commissioned as an Infantry Officer in the US Army in 2016, also earning my Bachelors of Science in electrical 
                engineering. I graduated the US Army Ranger School in 2017 and spent the following 5 years in various leadership roles that 
                taught me a lot about leading teams of people, managing valuable resources, and budgeting the most precious commodity of 
                all: <em>time</em>. I recently exited the military (2022) and am now following my dream of learning to code by attending the 
                Code Fellows Software Development bootcamp.

            <h3>What Do I Like to Do?</h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I love to spend my time outside in the fresh air, and I'm especially passionate about the wilderness and 
                maintaining the integrity of public lands. I love to hunt, fish, hike, camp, rock climb, surf, SCUBA dive, swim, and the 
                list goes on.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, I'm certainly not above sitting on the couch with a bowl of ice cream and watching some TV. I'm a big fan of 
                anime, but i'll really watch anything except Grey's Anatomy. When it comes to realism, I draw the line at doctors being impaled 
                by falling icicles at the hospital...
